# KitPvP-Datapack
A Minecraft KitPvP Datapack by Up-Level and Tet.

This datapack is used for a KitPvP Server which runs only using functions. This is balanced for post-1.9 combat, while allowing variety and strategy in between classes.
Eventually, we might make this server public if the project goes far enough.
