# KitPvP-Datapack
A 1.16.2 Minecraft KitPvP Datapack by Up-Level and Tet.

This datapack is made for a KitPvP Server designed to use the pack. Balanced for 1.9+ combat, while allowing variety and strategy in between classes.
Eventually, the server may become public if the project goes far enough.

Note that this datapack is designed for a specific world with a specific resource pack. While the dependency on the resource pack will remain in the future the datapack could later work on another world without much modification.
