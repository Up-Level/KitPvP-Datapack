# KitPvP-Datapack
A Minecraft KitPvP Datapack by Up-Level and Tet.

This datapack is made for a KitPvP Server which runs only using functions. Balanced for post-1.9 combat, while allowing variety and strategy in between classes.
Eventually, we might make this server public if the project goes far enough.

Note that this datapack is designed for a specific world with a specific resource pack. While the dependency on the resource pack will remain in the future the datapack could work on another world without much modification.
